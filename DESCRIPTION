Description: This package estimates the optimal individualized treatment rule
    for the categorical treatment using Super Learner (sl3). In order to avoid
    nested cross-validation, it uses split-specific estimates of Q and g to
    estimate the rule as described by Coyle et al. In addition, it provides the
    Targeted Maximum Likelihood estimates of the mean performance using CV-TMLE
    under such estimated rules. This is an adapter package for use with the
    tmle3 framework and the tlverse software ecosystem for Targeted Learning.
