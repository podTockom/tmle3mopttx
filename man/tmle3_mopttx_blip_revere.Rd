\title{Mean under the Optimal Individualized Treatment Rule}
\usage{
tmle3_mopttx_blip_revere(
  V = NULL,
  type = "blip1",
  learners,
  maximize = TRUE,
  complex = TRUE,
  realistic = FALSE,
  resource = 1,
  interpret = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{V}{Covariates the rule depends on.}

\item{type}{One of three psudo-blip versions developed to accommodate categorical treatment. "Blip1"
corresponds to chosing a reference category, and defining the blip for all other categories relative to the
specified reference. Note that in the case of binary treatment, "blip1" is just the usual blip.
"Blip2$ corresponds to defining the blip relative to the average of all categories. Finally,
"Blip3" corresponds to defining the blip relative to the weighted average of all categories.}

\item{learners}{Library for Y (outcome), A (treatment), and B (blip) estimation.}

\item{maximize}{Specify whether we want to maximize or minimize the mean of the final outcome.}

\item{complex}{If \code{TRUE}, learn the rule using the specified covariates \code{V}. If
\code{FALSE}, check if a less complex rule is better.}

\item{realistic}{If \code{TRUE}, it will return a rule what is possible due to practical positivity constraints.}

\item{resource}{Indicates the percent of initially estimated individuals who should be given treatment that
get treatment, based on their blip estimate. If resource = 1 all estimated individuals to benefit from
treatment get treatment, if resource = 0 none get treatment.}

\item{interpret}{If \code{TRUE}, returns a HAL fit of the blip, explaining the rule.}
