## Description

Suppose one wishes to maximize (or minimize) the population mean of an outcome where for each individual one has access to measured baseline covariates. We consider estimation of the mean outcome under the optimal rule, where the candidate rules are restricted to depend only on user-supplied subset of the baseline covariates (or no covariates specified). The estimation problem is addressed in a statistical model for the data distribution that is nonparametric. 

The `tmle3mopttx` is an adapter/extension R package in the `tlverse` ecosystem, that estimates the mean outcome under the following regimes:

(1) **Optimal Individualized Treatment for categorical treatment,**
(2) **Optimal Individualized Treatment based on possibly sub-optimal rules (including static rules),**
(3) **Optimal Individualized Treatment based on realistic rules.**
(4) **Optimal Individualized Treatment with resource constraints.**

The `tmle3mopttx` also provides **variable importance** analysis in terms of optimizing the population mean of an outcome for settings (1)-(3). It also can return an **interpretable rule** based on a Highly Adaptive Lasso fit. 

In addition, `tmle3mopttx` supports estimating the mean outcome under regimes under the following missigness process:

1. **Missing outcome.** 

In order to avoid nested cross-validation, `tmle3mopttx` relies on split-specific estimates of the conditional expectation of the outcome ($\mathbb{E}_0(Y|A,W)$) and conditional probability of treatment ($P_0(A|W)$) in order to estimate the rule. The targeted maximum likelihood estimates of the mean performance under the estimated rule are obtained using CV-TMLE. 

The description of the method implemented, with simulations and data examples using `tmle3mopttx` can be found in @malenica2021opttx.
