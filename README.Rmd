> Targeted Learning and Variable Importance with Optimal Individualized
> Categorical Treatment

Coyle](https://github.com/jeremyrcoyle) and [Mark J. van der
Laan](https://vanderlaan-lab.org/)

## Description

Suppose one wishes to maximize (or minimize) the population mean of an outcome
using a categorical point treatment, where for each individual one has access to
measured baseline covariates. We consider estimation of the mean outcome under
the optimal rule, where the candidate rules are restricted to depend only on
user-supplied subset of the baseline covariates. The estimation problem is
addressed in a statistical model for the data distribution that is
nonparametric, and at most places restrictions on the probability of a patient
receiving treatment given covariates. In addition, suppose one wishes to assess
the importance of each observed covariate, in terms of maximizing (or
minimizing) the population mean of an outcome under an optimal individualized
treatment regime.

`tmle3mopttx` is an adapter/extension R package in the `tlverse` ecosystem, that
addresses the above mentioned problems. The goal of this work is to build upon
the `tlverse` framework and the estimation methodology implemented for a single
mean counterfactual outcome in order to introduce an end-to-end methodology for
variable importance analyses. It relies on the modern implementation of the
Super Learner algorithm, [sl3](https://github.com/tlverse/sl3), and
[tmle3](https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3) for the targeting step.

In order to avoid nested cross-validation, `tmle3mopttx` relies on
split-specific estimates of $\mathbb{E}(Y|A,W)$ and $P(A|W)$ in order to
estimate the rule, as described by @jeremythesis In addition, the targeted
maximum likelihood estimates of the mean performance under the estimated rule
are obtained using CV-TMLE. The implementation supports categorical treatments,
providing three different versions for the rule estimation, as well as
Q-learning.

individualized treatment regimes, please consider consulting @vdl2007super,
